How to Run
Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install numpy pandas faiss-cpu

Run the Scripts in Order:
First, run convert_to_embeddings.py to generate and save embeddings and metadata.
bash

python convert_to_embeddings.py

Next, run store_in_vector_db.py to create and save the FAISS index.
bash

python store_in_vector_db.py

Finally, run retrieve_for_inference.py to perform a semantic search and prepare context for inference.
bash

python retrieve_for_inference.py



CSV Drawbacks: As noted earlier, CSV is not the most efficient format for embeddings due to its size and speed, but itâ€™s human-readable and easy to inspect, which might be useful for debugging or small-scale projects.

Generalization: Users can plug in their own embedding model by replacing the placeholder logic, making this implementation flexible for different use cases.
