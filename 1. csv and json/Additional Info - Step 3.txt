Script 3: retrieve_for_inference.py
This script retrieves relevant conversations using semantic search and prepares them for LLM inference.

Model Placeholder: Added a comment for model loading and a placeholder for query embedding (np.random.rand) to keep the script focused on retrieval logic.

Loading Metadata: Loads metadata.json as before.

Retrieval and Formatting: Same as before, retrieves the top-2 conversations and formats them as context.

Dependencies: Requires numpy and faiss-cpu (pip install numpy faiss-cpu).
