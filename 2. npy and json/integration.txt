How to Run
Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install numpy faiss-cpu

Run the Scripts in Order:
First, run convert_to_embeddings.py to generate and save embeddings and metadata.
bash

python convert_to_embeddings.py

Next, run store_in_vector_db.py to create and save the FAISS index.
bash

python store_in_vector_db.py

Finally, run retrieve_for_inference.py to perform a semantic search and prepare context for inference.
bash

python retrieve_for_inference.py


NumPy Benefits: Using .npy for embeddings is more efficient than CSV (smaller file size, faster read/write) and is a better fit for numerical data like embeddings, though itâ€™s not human-readable.

Modularity: Users can insert their own embedding model by replacing the placeholder logic, maintaining flexibility.
