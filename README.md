## Features

- **Vector-Based Memory**: Latent Memory utilizes a vector-based approach to store and retrieve information, improving the model's ability to remember and use context.
- **Enhanced Inference**: By integrating this memory system, the module enhances the inference capabilities of LLMs, allowing for more nuanced and context-aware responses.
- **Semantic Understanding**: The use of embeddings helps in capturing deeper semantic meanings, leading to better comprehension of queries and prompts.
- **Flexibility**: The module can be adapted for various applications, from chatbots to complex data analysis.

## Installation

To install Latent Memory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErosEXE0/latentmemory.git
   cd latentmemory
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ErosEXE0/latentmemory/releases). You will need to download and execute the appropriate file for your system.

## Usage

To use Latent Memory in your project, import the module and initialize it with your language model. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
from latentmemory import LatentMemory

# Initialize your language model
model = LatentMemory()

# Use the model to process input
response = model.infer("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

### Example Scenarios

- **Chatbots**: Use Latent Memory to create more interactive and context-aware chatbots.
- **Data Analysis**: Enhance data analysis tools by integrating memory for better contextual understanding.
- **Personal Assistants**: Build personal assistants that remember user preferences and past interactions.
