How to Run
Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install numpy faiss-cpu

Run the Scripts in Order:
First, run convert_to_embeddings.py to generate and save embeddings and metadata in latent_memory.pkl.
bash

python convert_to_embeddings.py

Next, run store_in_vector_db.py to create and save the FAISS index.
bash

python store_in_vector_db.py

Finally, run retrieve_for_inference.py to perform a semantic search and prepare context for inference.
bash

python retrieve_for_inference.py

.
Single File Storage: By storing both embeddings and metadata in latent_memory.pkl, this implementation ensures consistency and simplifies file management, similar to the HDF5 approach.


Pickle Considerations:
Pros: Simple to use, flexible (can serialize most Python objects), and consolidates everything into one file.

Cons: Less robust than HDF5 or NumPy+JSON. Pickle files can pose security risks (arbitrary code execution when loading untrusted files) and may not be compatible across Python versions or library versions.

Modularity: The placeholder for model loading keeps the scripts flexible, allowing users to insert their preferred embedding model.
