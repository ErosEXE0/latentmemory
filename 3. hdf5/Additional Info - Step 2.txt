Script 2: store_in_vector_db.py
This script loads the embeddings and metadata from the HDF5 file and creates a FAISS index for semantic search.

Loading from HDF5: Loads both embeddings and metadata from latent_memory.h5. The metadata is a NumPy structured array with fields conversation_id, summary, and timestamp.

FAISS Index: Creates a FAISS index using IndexFlatIP, as before.

Dependencies: Requires numpy, h5py, and faiss-cpu (pip install numpy h5py faiss-cpu).
