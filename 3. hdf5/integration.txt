How to Run
Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install numpy h5py faiss-cpu

Run the Scripts in Order:
First, run convert_to_embeddings.py to generate and save embeddings and metadata in latent_memory.h5.
bash

python convert_to_embeddings.py

Next, run store_in_vector_db.py to create and save the FAISS index.
bash

python store_in_vector_db.py

Finally, run retrieve_for_inference.py to perform a semantic search and prepare context for inference.
bash

python retrieve_for_inference.py



Single File Storage: By storing both embeddings and metadata in latent_memory.h5, this implementation ensures consistency and simplifies file management, as you noted earlier.



HDF5 Benefits: HDF5 provides scalability and the ability to store structured data (via compound types for metadata), making it a robust choice for this prototype.

Modularity: The placeholder for model loading keeps the scripts flexible, allowing users to insert their preferred embedding model.
